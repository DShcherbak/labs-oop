### Data structures
Graphs based on adjacency structure and adjacency matrix, that can store any data type (`int`, `double`, `std::string`,` std::vector<>`).

**Methods implemented:**
- [x] add node
- [x] add edge
- [x] find node by value
- [x] delete node by index
- [x] delete node by value
- [x] delete edge
- [x] check nodes adjacency
- [x] check graph adjacency
- [x] distance between two nodes (based on Floyd's algorithm)
- [x] print

### Custom class
A dice with face number N = 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 20.
Every face has own probability of being dropped.
